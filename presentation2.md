[our system is extendable to other problems such as school distict mapping, etc]

In following the spirit of OpenDataSTL, we have built a powerful REST backend for accessing and analyzing court data. On top of that, we have built a lean web app so that citizens can navigate the maze that is the Municipal Court System. 

As with all things legal, it's a mess, thus we have compiled a section for helping find legal help. [Legal help section]

[court lookup demo] For those that need help finding the court that they need to contest at, we have a powerful freeform court lookup tool.

[ticket lookup demo] And who hasn't lost their ticket before? We have a easy way to look up your citations! We can even direct you to the correct payment system or set reminders.

[warrant lookup demo] Stuff happens in life, maybe you have an active warrant; our warrant lookup tool can tell you if you are screwed!!! Additionally, you can set an alert for any newcoming warrant.

Our system is live and running. Just feed it data from any municipality or region to enable citizens power over their court system.
